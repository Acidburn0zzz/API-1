## Authentication

### For ZenHub users
All requests to the API need an API token. Generate a token in the [Settings](https://dashboard.zenhub.io/#/settings) section of your ZenHub Dashboard.
Note: Each user may only have one token, so generating a new token will make any previous tokens invalid.

The token is sent in the `X-Authentication-Token` header. For example, using `curl` it'd be `curl -H 'X-Authentication-Token: TOKEN' URL`. Alternatively, you can send the token in the URL using the `access_token` query string attribute. To do so, add ```?access_token=TOKEN``` to any url.

### For ZenHub Enterprise users
Please follow the instruction in https://{{zenhub_enterprise_host}}/setup/howto/api

## Endpoints

Here are the current endpoints available for ZenHub's API.

### Get issue data


```
GET https://api.zenhub.io/p1/repositories/:repo_id/issues/:issue_number
```

Please note: `repo_id` is the ID of the repository, not its full name. For example, the ID of the `ZenHubIO/support` repository is `13550592`.
To find out the ID of your repository, use [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get).

Issue number is the same as displayed in your GitHub Issues page. For example, to fetch the [ZenHub API](https://github.com/ZenHubIO/support/issues/172) issue information, the URL would be `https://api.zenhub.io/p1/repositories/13550592/issues/172`.

The endpoint returns that issue's assigned _Time Estimate_ (if applicable), its _Pipeline_ in the Board, an _is epic_ flag (true/false), as well as any _+1s_.

NOTE: Closed issues might take up to one minute to show up in the Closed pipeline. Similarly, reopened issues might take up to one minute to show in the right pipeline.

Here is an example of returned JSON data:
```json
{
  "estimate": {
    "value": 8
  },
  "plus_ones": [
    {
      "user_id": 16717,
      "created_at": "2015-12-11T18:43:22.296Z"
    }
  ],
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "In Progress"
  },
  "is_epic": true
}
```

### Get issue events

```
GET https://api.zenhub.io/p1/repositories/:repo_id/issues/:issue_number/events
```

Please note: `repo_id` is the ID of the repository, not its full name. For example, the ID of the `ZenHubIO/support` repository is `13550592`.
To find out the ID of your repository, use [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get).

Issue number is the same one displayed in your GitHub Issues page. For example, to fetch the [ZenHub Public API](https://github.com/ZenHubIO/support/issues/172) issue information, the URL would be `https://api.zenhub.io/p1/repositories/13550592/issues/172`.

The endpoint returns that issue's events, sorted by most recent. Each event contains the _User ID_ of the person who performed the change, the _Creation Date_ of the event, and _Type_. Type can be either `estimateIssue` or `transferIssue`. Old and new values are included for both event types.

Here is an example of returned JSON data:
```json
[
  {
    "user_id": 16717,
    "type": "estimateIssue",
    "created_at": "2015-12-11T19:43:22.296Z",
    "from_estimate": {
      "value": 8
    }
  },
  {
    "user_id": 16717,
    "type": "estimateIssue",
    "created_at": "2015-12-11T18:43:22.296Z",
    "from_estimate": {
      "value": 4
    },
    "to_estimate": {
      "value": 8
    }
  },
  {
    "user_id": 16717,
    "type": "estimateIssue",
    "created_at": "2015-12-11T13:43:22.296Z",
    "to_estimate": {
      "value": 4
    }
  },
  {
    "user_id": 16717,
    "type": "transferIssue",
    "created_at": "2015-12-11T12:43:22.296Z",
    "from_pipeline": {
      "name": "Backlog"
    },
    "to_pipeline": {
      "name": "In progress"
    }
  },
  {
    "user_id": 16717,
    "type": "transferIssue",
    "created_at": "2015-12-11T11:43:22.296Z",
    "to_pipeline": {
      "name": "Backlog"
    }
  }
]
```

### Get the ZenHub Board data for a repository

```
GET https://api.zenhub.io/p1/repositories/:repo_id/board
```

Note: The `repo_id` is the ID of the repository, not the full name. For example, the ID of the `ZenHubIO/support` repository is `13550592`. Use [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get) to find out your repository's ID.

For example, the URL to fetch the [ZenHubIO/support](https://github.com/ZenHubIO/support#boards) board would be `https://api.zenhub.io/p1/repositories/13550592/board`.

The endpoint returns the Board's pipelines, plus the issues contained within each pipeline. It returns each issues' _issue number_, its _position_ in the board, an _is epic_ flag(true/false), and its _Time Estimate_ (if one is assigned).

Even if the issues are returned in the right order, the _position_ can't be guessed from its index. Notice some issues won't have _position_ â€“ this is because they have not been prioritized on your Board.

Note: The Board returned by the endpoint doesn't include closed issues. To get closed issues for a repository, you can use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-issues). Reopened issues might take up to one minute to appear in the correct pipeline.

This is an example of returned JSON data:
```json
{
  "pipelines": [
    {
      "name": "New Issues",
      "issues": [
        {
          "issue_number": 279,
          "estimate": {
            "value": 40
          },
          "position": 0,
          "is_epic": true
        },
        {
          "issue_number": 142,
          "is_epic": false
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Backlog",
      "issues": [
        {
          "issue_number": 303,
          "estimate": {
            "value": 40
          },
          "position": 3,
          "is_epic": false
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "To Do",
      "issues": [
        {
          "issue_number": 380,
          "estimate": {
            "value": 1
          },
          "position": 0,
          "is_epic": true
        },
        {
          "issue_number": 284,
          "position": 2,
          "is_epic": false
        },
        {
          "issue_number": 329,
          "estimate": {
            "value": 8
          },
          "position": 7,
          "is_epic": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get Epics for a repository

```
GET https://api.zenhub.io/p1/repositories/:repo_id/epics
```

Please note: `repo_id` is the ID of the repository, not its full name. For example, the ID of the `ZenHubIO/support` repository is `13550592`.
To find out the ID of your repository, use [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get).

For example, the URL to fetch the [ZenHubIO/support](https://github.com/ZenHubIO/issues) epics would be `https://api.zenhub.io/p1/repositories/13550592/epics`.

The endpoint returns an array of the repository's epics. For each epic, _issue number_, _repository ID_, and the _GitHub issue URL_ is provided.

Note: If an issue is only an issue belonging to an epic (and not a parent epic), it is not considered an epic and won't be included in the return array.

Here is an example of returned JSON data:

```json
{
  "epic_issues": [
    {
      "issue_number": 3953,
      "repo_id": 1234567,
      "issue_url": "https://github.com/RepoOwner/RepoName/issues/3953"
    },
    {
      "issue_number": 1342,
      "repo_id": 1234567,
      "issue_url": "https://github.com/RepoOwner/RepoName/issues/1342"
    },
  ]
}
```

### Get Epic data

```
GET https://api.zenhub.io/p1/repositories/:repo_id/epics/:epic_id
```
Please note: `repo_id` is the ID of the repository, not its full name. For example, the ID of the `ZenHubIO/support` repository is `13550592`.
To find out the ID of your repository, use [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get).

`epic_id` is the GitHub issue number (you may fetch the list of epics using **Get Epics for a repository** endpoint).

The endpoint returns the _total estimate epic value_ (the sum of the epic's estimate, plus all estimates contained within it), the _estimate of the epic_, _pipeline name_ the epic is in, and the _issues_ belonging to it. For each issue belonging to the epic, its _issue number_, _repo id_, _estimate value_, _is epic_ flag (true/false) are provided; in addition, if the issue is from the same repository as the epic, the ZenHub Board's _pipeline name_ (from the repo the epic is in) is attached.

NOTE: If an issue is from a different repository than the epic it belongs to, the pipeline name is not attached.

```json
{
  "total_epic_estimates": {
    "value": 60
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "issue_number": 3161,
      "is_epic": true,
      "repo_id": 1099029,
      "estimate": {
        "value": 40
      },
      "pipeline": {
        "name": "New Issues"
      }
    },
    {
      "issue_number": 2,
      "is_epic": false,
      "repo_id": 1234567,
      "estimate": {
        "value": 10
      },
      "pipeline": {
        "name": "New Issues"
      }
    },
    {
      "issue_number": 1,
      "is_epic": false,
      "repo_id": 1234567
    },
    {
      "issue_number": 6,
      "is_epic": false,
      "repo_id": 1234567
    },
    {
      "issue_number": 7,
      "is_epic": true,
      "repo_id": 9876543
    }
  ],
  "estimate": {
    "value": 10
  },
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "Backlog"
  }
}
```

### Move issue between pipelines

`position` can be either a String with the values `top` or `bottom`, which will move the issue to the top or the bottom of the specified pipeline. They can also be specified as numbers (i.e `"position": 3`), which will define the desired slot that the issue should take in the pipeline. This number is based off a zero index, which means 0 is equal to the `top` of the pipeline.

#### Response
- `200` if the move was successful.

`Does not return any body in the response.`

### Set estimate for issue

## API limits

We allow 100 requests per minute to our API. All requests responses include some headers related to this limitation.

Header | Meaning
------ | -------
X-RateLimit-Limit | Total number of requests allowed before the reset time
X-RateLimit-Used | Number of requests sent in the current cycle. Will be set to 0 at the reset time.
X-RateLimit-Reset | Time in UTC epoch seconds when the usage gets reset.

To avoid time differences between your computer and our servers, we suggest to use the `Date` header in the response to know exactly when the limit is reset.

## Errors

The ZenHub API can return the following errors:

Status Code | Meaning
----------- | -------
401 | The token is not valid. See [Authentication](#authentication).
403 | Reached request limit to the API. See [API Limits](#api-limits).
404 | Not found.


## Webhooks

You can use our webhooks to fetch or store your ZenHub data, in real time, across services like Slack, Gitter, Spark, HipChat, or something custom!

To set up an integration, head on over to our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.zenhub.com/), navigate to your organization, and select the **Integrations** tab. From there, you may choose one of the 5 services (Slack, HipChat, Gitter, Spark, or Custom).

For instructions, you'll notice the `How to create a webhook` link changes dynamically based on the service you select. Simply choose a repository with which to connect, add an optional description, paste your webhook, and click "Add" to save your new integration.

### Custom webhooks

Our custom webhook sends a POST request to your webhook for multiple events that occur on your ZenHub board:

#### Issue transfer

```json
{
  "type": "issue_transfer",
  "github_url": "https://github.com/ZenHubIO/support/issues/618",
  "organization": "ZenHubHQ",
  "repo": "support",
  "user_name": "ZenHubIO",
  "issue_number": "618",
  "issue_title": "ZenHub Change Log",
  "to_pipeline_name": "New Issues",
  "from_pipeline_name": "Discussion"
}
```

#### Estimate Set

```json
{
  "type": "estimate_set",
  "github_url": "https://github.com/ZenHubIO/support/issues/618",
  "organization": "ZenHubHQ",
  "repo": "support",
  "user_name": "ZenHubIO",
  "issue_number": "618",
  "issue_title": "ZenHub Change Log",
  "estimate": "8"
}
```

#### Estimate Cleared

```json
{
  "type": "estimate_cleared",
  "github_url": "https://github.com/ZenHubIO/support/issues/618",
  "organization": "ZenHubHQ",
  "repo": "support",
  "user_name": "ZenHubIO",
  "issue_number": "618",
  "issue_title": "ZenHub Change Log",
}
```

#### Issue Reprioritized

```json
{
  "type": "issue_reprioritized",
  "github_url": "https://github.com/ZenHubIO/support/issues/618",
  "organization": "ZenHubHQ",
  "repo": "support",
  "user_name": "ZenHubIO",
  "issue_number": "618",
  "issue_title": "ZenHub Change Log",
  "to_pipeline_name": "Backlog",
  "from_position": "4",
  "to_position": "0"
}
```


As an example, here's a simple Node/Express app that would be able receive the webhooks(using ngrok):

```
var express       = require('express');
var http          = require('http');
var bodyParser    = require('body-parser');
var app           = express();

http.createServer(app).listen('6000', function(){
 console.log('Listening on 6000');
});

app.use(bodyParser());


app.post('*', function( req, res) {
 console.dir(req.body);
});
```
